Project 1: Advanced CSS Course

This is the first project from the Advanced CSS course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.com

This project is an example of a multi-page, multi-browser and responsive web application to take in details for people looking to book from a range of offered holidays.  It uses the latest CSS and SCSS type SASS to enable functionality.  

This project shows the ability of CSS3 up to the boundary of where JavaScript is needed to take the functionality further.

The code is ready to be put through a basic build process.

The design is free for private or commercial use, but all design credits belong to Jonas Schmedtmann.
